👋 Hi, I’m [@jgonzal1](https://github.com/jgonzal1)

👀 I’m interested in nature preservation, web development, and real-estate investing.
The "nodejs" archived repo is currently a big private repo "thingy"
that will be released any time soon e.e, will keep you posted!

🌱 I’m currently learning [React.JS](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/react-101/) and Real Estate Investing (Updated 2023)

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nature preservation projects and real estate investing

📫 How to reach me: e-mail / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javigbe)
